//for in loop
//for (let key in person)

we need to use for (let key in person)
for (let key in person)

place
age

for (let key in person)
console.log(key,person[key]);
name mosh

//constructor function
Construction function,instead of returing an object
 we will use diff approach to initialize the obj

executing (this will refer to empty obj)

//when we use new 3 things will happen,new will create empty object
and itwill set this to empty obj, it will return obj from functioncircle

//construcote function is senior

// dynamic nature of objects
objects in js are dynamic which means once we create them we can always add
 new properties are method or removing exisitng once.

 we adding new properties and methods for circle objects
 const circle = {
    radius:1
 };

 circle.color ='yellow';
 circle.draw =function (){

 }
 console.log(circle);

//every obj in js has a property called constructor that reference
 the function that was used to construct or create that obj
undefined

///////////////////////
Functions are objects
//object will not store in the variable some where it will store in the memory and address of that memory location
is stored inside the variable

//primitives are copied by their value 
and objects are copied by their reference

when we use an object that obj is not stored in the variable 
let x= it will store some where else in the memory
//and address of that memory location stored inside the variable
 (when we copy x=y is the address of the ref we are copying
undefined

in primitive types we deal with 2 independent copies and in ref types
 it will copy by there reference

 //enumerating properties of an object
/we can iterate over all properties and methods of an obj

const circle4 ={
radius: 1,
draw() {
console.log('draw');
}
};

for(let key in circle4);
console.log(key);
radius
draw

//we can use entry, it will return each key value pair as an array
const circle9 ={
radius: 1,
draw() {
console.log('draw');
}
};
for (let entry of Object.entries(circle9))
console.log(entry);
VM10120:9 (2) ["radius", 1]
VM10120:9 (2) ["draw", ƒ]

to check if a given object has given property or method
with in operator we can see if the property is exist in a given object

const circle10 ={
radius: 1,
draw() {
console.log('draw');
}
};
if ('radius' in circle10) console.log('yes');
VM10266:8 yes

the simplest way to enumerate the properties of an object is 
using for in loop, we can use for of loop along with 
object.keys and object.entries.
-finally if a given a property is exist in an obj, we use in operator

//cloning the object

how to enumerate properties of object using this technic we will all properties in object and copy them to another object
below appraoch for copying and cloning of object is old in modern js we have better ways to achieve this we need to use
object.assign method
const circle = {
radius:1,
draw() {
console.log('draw');
}
};

const another = {};
for (let key in circle)
another[key] = circle[key];
console.log(another);

//object.assign method it takes all the properties on method in the object and copies them

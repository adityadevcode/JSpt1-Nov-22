    <h3> Classes in JS</h3>
    <h4>-why do we use classes instead of functions

        functional programming or object oriented programming (oop)
        1.oop focuses on using class, objects and methods to make code run
        2.functional programming focuses on functions
        3.For example, storing properties and methods in an object can allow 
        for a certain amount of self-referential behaviour, and good organisation. 
        If you need to find something for a particular school, you know that the 
        object for that school will contain the information you need. It also allows 
        for inheritance from parent classes, meaning you can have many object instances,
        
        4.we have a lot of small functions that to specific tasks
        5.classes can have methods, this keyword can behave a bit counter intutitively
        with functional prog this issue doesnt exist
        
        6.When you’re dealing with real world objects, generally classes and class instances 
        work much better than functions. These are things that aren’t impossible with functions,
         but just don’t work as well to model as a class does.
        ---------------------
        
        -for years, OOP (object-oriented programming) was the de-facto standard in software engineering.
        -The concepts of classes, polymorphism, inheritance, and incapsulation dominated and revolutionized the development process.
         But everything has an expiration date, programming paradigms included.
        -why it is a bad idea to use classes in JavaScript, and what are some of the alternatives.
        
        classes in js
        classess were introduced in es6 to provide a cleaner way to follow object oriented programming patters
        -js follows a prototype based inheritance model

   constructor(name,color,price) {
     this.name=name;

// it consists of a prototype property, this is the prototype
that all the instances of class chair will have
//we have the __proto__  or [[Prototype]] property. 
This is the actual prototype of the class Chair.

//Abstract function and inheritance in chair management system
The abstract function is just a function signature in a class without any implementation. 
It helps us generalize the code so that the subclasses 
can use them and add their own implementation to it.

//this is a class inherits the function and attributes from
the superclass chair.
-it uses the extends keyword to allow the officeCahir class to 
perform inheritance

extends keyword has following syntax
class ChildClass extends ParentClass{...}

//next we have constructor  function and the implmentation of
some of the functions from the superclass
//we are using super keyword in constructor
//we use super keyword to call constructor of the parent class
we can also use it to call functions and propertirs of the parent class

///call suoer function at the start of the constructor if you dont
it will give error
//once the super function is called then we can access all the attributes
and functions of the parent class


//second topic 
how to use the static keyowrd in classes
//main purpose is used for a constant variable or a method that is the 
same for every instance of class
//static methods are called directly on the class (car for example).
without creating an instance/object (mycar of the class)

a static class cannot be instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the
 new operator to create a variable of the class type.

 lass Chair {
//Defaults that will be common for all the instances:
    static backSupport = true;
    static armRests = true;
    
    constructor(color, seatHeight, recliningAngle, headSupport, padding, seatSize, isHeightAdjustable, isMovable){
        //Defaults which can be changed by the subclass class.
        this.color = color;
        this.seatHeight = seatHeight;
        this.recliningAngle = recliningAngle;

///private members of classes in js
Private members are members of the class which can only be used 
internally by the class itself. They cannot be accessed outside
 the class. Even the instances of the class cannot access these private members.


 All private members are declared using #<propertName> syntax. 
    They are generally called hash names.
//in chair class component, if we want to add default billing information
//new properties inside the officeChair class
// we dont want other classes to interfere with the billing information
of other classes. to handle this we an use private fields

//addition of the following fields
price/maximum discount/ seller address

class OfficeChair extends Chair {
	//Newly Added Properties
	#basePrice;
	#maxDiscount;
	#sellerAddress;

	constructor(type, color, isHeightAdjustable, seatHeight, recliningAngle) {
		super();
		this.type = type;
		this.color = color;
		this.isHeightAdjustable = isHeightAdjustable;
		this.seatHeight = seatHeight;
		this.recliningAngle = recliningAngle;
		this.isMovable = true;
		this.#basePrice = 1000;
		this.#maxDiscount = 5; //In percentage
		this.#sellerAddress = "XYZ, street";
	}

	adjustableHeight(height) {
		if (height > this.seatHeight) {
			console.log(`Chair height changed to ${height}`);
		} else {
			console.log(`Height cannot be decreased more than the seat height ${this.seatHeight}`);
		}
	}

	adjustAngle(angle) {
		if (angle >= this.recliningAngle) {
			console.log(`Chair angle changed to ${angle}`);
		} else {
			console.log(`Angle cannot be decreased more than the min reclining angle ${this.recliningAngle}`);
		}
	}

	moveChair(x, y) {
		console.log(`Chair moved to co-ordinates = (${x}, ${y})`);
	}

	//Newly Added function
	#getChairAmount(taxCharge) {
		return this.#basePrice + (this.#basePrice - this.#basePrice * this.#maxDiscount / 100) + taxCharge;
	}

	//Newly Added function
	generateBill() {
		console.log("**** BILLING INFORMATION ****");
		console.log(`Chair Price = ${this.#getChairAmount(20)}`);
		console.log(`Seller Address = ${this.#sellerAddress}`);
	}
}

output
newOfficeChair.generateBill()
*****Billing Information******
Chair Price =1979
Seller Address = XYZ, street

This function accesses the private fields and function within the class to
 generate the billing information.

 These private variables will only be accessible within the class itself. 
 If you try to reference any of the private members of the class then it will
  throw a syntax error like below

class DinningChair extends OfficeChair{}
let dineChair = new DinningChair();
dineChair.#basePrice(); //Throws syntax error

private class members can be created by using a hash # prefix.

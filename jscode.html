//objects:
var person = { 
 firstName:"John", 
 lastName:"Doe", 
 age:20, 
 nationality:"German" 
};
console.log(person);

//obj has key value pairs which is data (strng num booleans)
//strings, numbers, booleans,methods (Which are functions contianed within an obj)
//objs in reallife book- title/author/pages/gener
//car -color/make/model/horsepower
//js arrays also a type of object
//objs are integral and foundational aspect of js programs
//real time exp user account obj contain usernames, password, email
//web shopping shopping cart contains array of many obj such as each item
name/price/weight/size
//how to create obj, obj properties, methods, how to access, add,
delelte, modify and loop through obj properties
////////////
2 ways to construct an obj in js 
obj literal {}, obj construtor uses new keyword
-empty obj //obj literal
const objectLiteral = {};
-object constructor
const objectConstructor = new Object();

//obj literals are prefered way
const gimli = {
	name: "Gimli",
	race: "dwarf",
	weapon: "axe",
	greet: function() {
		return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}!`;
	},
};
//method is greet/method value consiting of the contents of a function
//within greet we notice this, when using this inside obj it refers to current obj which is gimli

//properties and method
objs can have properties and methods
properties:key value pairs
methods:is a function that is the value of an obj property
task that obj can perform
//property as a noun (name, race, weapon)
//methods as a verb(fight(), talk())

//two ways to access obj properties
dot notation.  gimi.weapon;
bracket notation []. gimi["weapon"];
//dot notation is faster and more readble
//bracket notation [] allow access to property names stored in a variable
//to retrieve obj method, we should call it as regular function
gili.greet();

//adding and modifying obj properties
adding new age property to gimli
gimli.age=139;
gimil["age"="132"]

//method can also be added to obj using same process
gimli.fight = function() {
    return ~attacks $some;
}
after creating a new method we can call method
gimli.fight();

//removing obj properties
we use delete 
delete gimli.weapon;
the delete operation evaluates as true if the property
is successfully removed

//looping through obj properties
js has build in type of for loop specailly iterating over the
properties of object
//iterating over obj proper for in loop

const gimli = {
	name: "Gimli",
	race: "dwarf",
	weapon: "battle axe",
};

//iterating through prop
for (let key in gimli) {
    console.log(gimli[key]);
}

op:gimli
dwarf
battle

//retrieve the property name only, coverting the key values to
upper case
for (let Key in gimli) {
    console.log(key.toUpperCase() + ':', gimli[key]);
}

op:NAME: Gimli
RACE: dwarf
WEAPON: battle axe

//for of loop used extensively on array obj type

//another enumeration method is the object.keys() method
which will return an array of the object keys
const gimli = {
	name: "Gimli",
	race: "dwarf",
	weapon: "battle axe",
};
Object.keys(gimli);
output:["name", "race", "weapon"]

/////////
Object methods in JS
-all obj in js descend from the parent _constructor
-obj has many built in methods
-obj method are used direclty on the obj constructor

//Object.create()
The Object.create() method is used to create a new object and link 
it to the prototype of an existing object.
The barista object now has one property — position — 
but all the other properties and methods from job are available 
through the prototype. Object.create() is useful for keeping code DRY by minimizing duplication.

//Object.keys()
creates an array containing the keys of an object.
We can create an object and print the array of keys.

//object.values()
creates an array containing the values of an object.

//object.entries()
creates a nested array of the key/value pairs of an object.

//object.assign()
is used to copy values from one object to another.
We can create two objects, and merge them with Object.assign().

//object.freeze()
prevents modification to properties and values of an object,
 and prevents properties from being added or removed from an object.

//object.seal()
prevents new properties from being added to an object,
 but allows the modification of existing properties. 
 This method is similar to Object.freeze().

//object.getPrototypeOf()
is used to get the internal hidden [[Prototype]] of an object, 
also accessible through the __proto__ property.


//Object.create(): create a new object and link to the prototype of an 
existing object.

// Initialize an object with properties and methods
const job = {
    position: 'cashier',
    type: 'hourly',
    isAvailable: true,
    showDetails() {
        const accepting = this.isAvailable ? 'is accepting applications' : "is not currently accepting applications";

        console.log(`The ${this.position} position is ${this.type} and ${accepting}.`);
    }
};

// Use Object.create to pass properties
const barista = Object.create(job);

barista.position = "barista";
barista.showDetails();
The barista position is hourly and is accepting applications.

********
The barista object now has one property — position — but all the other properties
 and methods from job are available through the prototype. Object.create() is useful 
 for keeping code DRY by minimizing duplication

//Object.keys():create an array containing keys of an obj
we can create an obj and print the arrays of keys
ex: accountant:'Oscar';
here only keys means accountant ["accountant"]
-we can use forEach() array method to iterate through keys and values
//Object.keys is also useful for checking the length of converted array
using the length property
const length = Object.keys(employees).length;
console.log(length);

//object.values()
creates an array containing the values of an obj

// Initialize an object
const session = {
    id: 1,
    time: `26-July-2018`,
    device: 'mobile',
    browser: 'Chrome'
};

// Get all values of the object
const values = Object.values(session);

console.log(values);
[1, "26-July-2018", "mobile", "Chrome"]

//Object.keys() and Object.values() allow you to return the data from an object.

//Object.entries()
creates a nested array of key value pairs of an obj

// Initialize an object
const operatingSystem = {
    name: 'Ubuntu',
    version: 18.04,
    license: 'Open Source'
};

// Get the object key/value pairs
const entries = Object.entries(operatingSystem);

console.log(entries);
[
    ["name", "Ubuntu"]
    ["version", 18.04]
    ["license", "Open Source"]
]

Once we have the key/value pair arrays, we can use the
 forEach() method to loop through and work with the results.
// Loop through the results
entries.forEach(entry => {
    let key = entry[0];
    let value = entry[1];

    console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
});

Output
name: Ubuntu
version: 18.04
license: Open Source

//object.assign()
used to copy values from one obj to another
we can create 2 objs and merge them with Object.assign()

const name = {
    firstName: 'Philip',
    lastName: 'Fry'
};

// Initialize another object
const details = {
    job: 'Delivery Boy',
    employer: 'Planet Express'
};

// Merge the objects
const character = Object.assign(name, details);

console.log(character);
{firstName: "Philip", lastName: "Fry", job: "Delivery Boy", employer: "Planet Express"}

// we can use spread operator ... to accomplish the same task
// Initialize an object
const name = {
    firstName: 'Philip',
    lastName: 'Fry'
};

// Initialize another object
const details = {
    job: 'Delivery Boy',
    employer: 'Planet Express'
};

// Merge the object with the spread operator
const character = {...name, ...details}

console.log(character);
{firstName: "Philip", lastName: "Fry", job: "Delivery Boy", employer: "Planet Express"}

//object.freeze()
prevents modification to properties and values of an obj
-prevent properties from being added or removed from an obj

const user = {
	username: 'AzureDiamond',
	password: 'hunter2'
};

// Freeze the object
const newUser = Object.freeze(user);

newUser.password = '*******';
newUser.active = true;

console.log(newUser);
{username: "AzureDiamond", password: "hunter2"}

//object.seal()
prevents new properties from being added to an object,
 but allows the modification of existing properties
const user = {
	username: 'AzureDiamond',
	password: 'hunter2'
};

// Seal the object
const newUser = Object.seal(user);

newUser.password = '*******';
newUser.active = true;

console.log(newUser);
{username: "AzureDiamond", password: "*******"}

//object.getPrototypeOf()
is used to get the internal hidden
 [[Prototype]] of an object, also accessible through the __proto__ property.

In this example, we can create an array, which has access to the Array prototype.
const employees = ['Ron', 'April', 'Andy', 'Leslie'];
Object.getPrototypeOf(employees);
Output
[constructor: ƒ, concat: ƒ, find: ƒ, findIndex: ƒ, pop: ƒ, …]

We can see in the output that the prototype of the employees array has access to pop, 
find, and other Array prototype methods. We can confirm this by testing the employees 
prototype against Array.prototype.


//////////////////////////////

//obj has many useful builtin methods,obj methods are used directly
on the obj constructor, and use the obj instance as a parameter. this is known as static method
build in objects methods

................................................

//arrays
-VERY USEFUL they store multiple values in a single variable, making it more readable and
maintainable
-arrays can contain any data type: numbers, strings,objects

let oceans = [
	"Pacific",
	"Atlantic",
	"Indian",
	"Arctic",
	"Antarctic",
];

//instead of creating 5 seperate variables we are creating an array
console.log(oceans);
//to access a specific item
oceans[0];

two ways to create array
-array literal uses square brackets above oceans
-array constructor which uses new keyword
let sharks = new Array(
    "hammer",
    "great",
    "lake",
);

//array literals are famous
//array are often used to group together lists of similiar data types
//after creating arrays we can manipulate them in many ways
//indexing (0,1,2,3)

//if we want to find out the index number of a specific item in an array
let seaCreatures = [
	"octopus",
	"squid",
	"shark",
	"seahorse",
	"starfish",
];
seaCreatures.length;5
seaCreatures.indexOf("seahorse"); 3
//if an index not found then -1
console.log(seaCreatures.indexOf("salmon"));-1

// accessing items in array
console.log(seaCreatures[1]); squid
//We know 0 will always output the first item in an array.
//We can also find the last item in an array by performing an 
operation on the length property

//to get last index value in array
const lastIndex = seaCreatures.length - 1;
seaCreatures[lastIndex]; starfish

//attemping to access an item that doesnt exist
will return undefined

//nested array
let nestedArray = [
	[
		"salmon",
		"halibut",
	],
	[
		"coral",
		"reef",
	]
];

nestedArray[1][0]; coral

//adding item to array
seaCreatures[5]="whale";
seaCreatures;

//adding an item out of index range
seaCreatures[7] = "pufferfish";
seaCreatures;

[ 'octopus',
	'squid',
	'shark',
	'seahorse',
	'starfish',
	'whale',
	,
	'pufferfish' ]

    //acces extra array item will return undefined
    seaCreatures[6]
    undefined

    //push() method, which adds an item to the end of the array
    // Append lobster to the end of the seaCreatures array
seaCreatures.push("lobster");
seaCreatures;

[ 'octopus',
	'squid',
	'shark',
	'seahorse',
	'starfish',
	,
	'whale',
	'pufferfish',
	'lobster' ]

   //unshift()method will add an item to begining of array
   // Append dragonfish to the beginning of the seaCreatures array
seaCreatures.unshift("dragonfish");

//remove specific items from array, we use splice()
seaCreatures.splice(7, 1);
seaCreatures;

//pop() method will remove the last item in ana array
seaCreatures.pop();

//shift() method to remove the first item in array
seaCreatures.shift();

//Modifying items in arrays
seaCreatures[0] = "manatee";

//another method of modifying array using splice() method
seaCreatures.splice(3, 1, "sea lion");

//looping through array
// Create an array of shellfish species
let shellfish = [
	"oyster",
	"shrimp",
	"clam",
	"mussel",
];

// Loop through the length of the array
for (let i = 0; i < shellfish.length; i++) {
  console.log(i, shellfish[i]);
}

Output
0 'oyster'
1 'shrimp'
2 'clam'
3 'mussel'

we can use for ... of loop
// Create an array of aquatic mammals
let mammals = [
	"dolphin",
	"whale",
	"manatee",
];

// Loop through each mammal
for (let mammal of mammals) {
	console.log(mammal);
}

Output
dolphin
whale
manatee

//the for...of loop does not retrieve the index number of the elements 
in the array, but it is generally a simpler, more concise way to loop through an array.

//Using loops is extremely useful for printing out the whole value of an array, 
such as when displaying the items from a database on a website.

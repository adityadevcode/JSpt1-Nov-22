variables in js: var/const/let
var:can be reassigned but only accessed within a fucntion
-variable declared with var move to the top when code is executed
const:cannot be reassinged and not accessible before they appear
let:let variable can be reassigned but not redeclared

//objects:
var person = { 
 firstName:"John", 
 lastName:"Doe", 
 age:20, 
 nationality:"German" 
};
console.log(person);

//obj has key value pairs which is data (strng num booleans)
//strings, numbers, booleans,methods (Which are functions contianed within an obj)
//objs in reallife book- title/author/pages/gener
//car -color/make/model/horsepower
//js arrays also a type of object
//objs are integral and foundational aspect of js programs
//real time exp user account obj contain usernames, password, email
//web shopping shopping cart contains array of many obj such as each item
name/price/weight/size
//how to create obj, obj properties, methods, how to access, add,
delelte, modify and loop through obj properties
////////////
2 ways to construct an obj in js 
obj literal {}, obj construtor uses new keyword
-empty obj //obj literal
const objectLiteral = {};
-object constructor
const objectConstructor = new Object();

//obj literals are prefered way
const gimli = {
	name: "Gimli",
	race: "dwarf",
	weapon: "axe",
	greet: function() {
		return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}!`;
	},
};
//method is greet/method value consiting of the contents of a function
//within greet we notice this, when using this inside obj it refers to current obj which is gimli

//properties and method
objs can have properties and methods
properties:key value pairs
methods:is a function that is the value of an obj property
task that obj can perform
//property as a noun (name, race, weapon)
//methods as a verb(fight(), talk())

//two ways to access obj properties
dot notation.  gimi.weapon;
bracket notation []. gimi["weapon"];
//dot notation is faster and more readble
//bracket notation allow access to property names stored in a variable
//to retrieve obj method, we should call it as regular function
gili.greet();

//adding and modifying obj properties
adding new age property to gimli
gimli.age=139;
gimil["age"="132"]









//obj has many useful builtin methods,obj methods are used directly
on the obj constructor, and use the obj instance as a parameter. this is known as static method
build in objects methods




//arrays
var fruits=["bananas", "apple","pear"];
console.log(fruits);
